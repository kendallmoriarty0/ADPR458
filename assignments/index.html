    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a junior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I double major in Sports Media & ADPR. I am from Wheaton, Illinois which is a suburb 40 minutes outside of Chicago.</p>

    <h3>Classes This Semester</h3>
    <p>ADPR362, ADPR458, WMNS101, JOMC486</p>

    <h3>Outside of Class</h3>
    <p>I am on the Women's Basketball team at Nebraska and have been playing for three years. I don't have a lot of free time, but when I do I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family.</p> 

    <h3>After Graduation</h3>
    <p>I don't have a set plan of what I exactly want to do after graduation. With my double major, I hope to stay in the sports world. I want to advertise for a professional sports team in a major city.</p>
