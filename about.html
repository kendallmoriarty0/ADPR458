                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I am a student-athlete at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I grew up in a suburb outside of Chicago called Wheaton. I have played basketball all of my life and have met so many great people along the way. Other than that, I have learned many life lessons that I will continue to use in my life as I grow up. I represent the women's basketball team and Nebraska Athletics department in the community, participating in a variety of outreach events including Boo at the Zoo, Food Drive, etc. </p>

                <p>Some experiences I have had is being a student-althete. I have built relationships with teammates and peers in the athletic department. They have taught me to push myself and those around me to be better in all aspects of life. I have learned to demonstrate responsibility, accountability, and teamwork at practices and competition. I have also gain experience being a basketball camp leader. I have done camps for Husker Women's Basketball, but have also held camps on my own. I have taught kids important lessons to utilize both on the basketball court and in life. I had to plan and lead drills to increase skill level of all facets of the game.  </p>
